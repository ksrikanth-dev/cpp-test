Arithmetic Operators:
********************
+	Addition	Adds together two values	x + y	
-	Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another	x - y	
*	Multiplication	Multiplies two values	x * y	
/	Division	Divides one value by another	x / y	
%	Modulus	Returns the division remainder	x % y	
++	Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
--	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x

Assignment Operators:
********************
=	x = 5	x = 5	
+=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
&=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3

Comparison Operators:
*********************
==	Equal to	x == y	
!=	Not equal	x != y	
>	Greater than	x > y	
<	Less than	x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

Logical Operators:
******************
&& 	Logical and	Returns true if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10	
|| 	Logical or	Returns true if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4	
!	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	!(x < 5 && x < 10)

Bitwise Operators:
******************
&	Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.
|	Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.
^	Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.
~	Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.
<<	Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
>>	Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.

 11000001
