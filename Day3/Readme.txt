- A structure in C/C++ is a user defined data type that allows us to group together the data items of heterogenous type.
Example: We can create a structure named Student to hold the data of a student like name, roll no, subjects, marks, grade, phone number etc.

- A union is a special data type that allows storing different data types in the same memory location.
We can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple purposes. 
In short, we can say - union allows us to create a versatile variable, which can hold data of any of it's member's type at any given time.
